# ☆ Portfolio (in React) ✨
It's 2021, which means an obligatory portfolio update. What better tech to use than React JS? Due to limitations with hosting on Github pages, I was unable to utilize React Router to achieve the portfolio I wanted, but I was able to adapt and create something that I am very proud of.

## ☆ Act 1: Scene 1 - Prologue
*... in fair Verona where we lay our scene*

## ☆ Act 2: Scene 2 - No Fear
*But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?*
